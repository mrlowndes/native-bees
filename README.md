## Native Bees of California 
Cinematographer Elliot Lowndes

## Synopsis
The film will first identify native bees as distinct from the honey bee, then the film will move on to cover the importance of native bees, the threats facing native bee populations, and the solutions to combat those threats - including native habitat restoration and preservation. I also want to take a deep dive into a couple of species’ life cycles. I think presenting a “season from the perspective of a bee” can help an audience empathize with them. 
By juxtaposing two species that nest in very different ways - perhaps the western leaf cutting bee and the bindweed turret bee, for example, I can also try to get across the massive diversity of native bee species. If there is time, I might try to squeeze in a bit about the spectrum of sociality between some species. After the life cycle chapter, perhaps I could also use a montage to communicate the thousands of remaining species that haven’t been covered in depth, from the tiny fairy bees to the giant valley carpenters.
